# ArachneMergeTool

## Feature

This program allows you to chain different merge tools when resolving conflicts.

The basic idea is to have simple automatic merging tools that can solve some tedious conflicts solving
(eg: import hell in java classes), and only launch interactive

## Usage

Clone this repository somewhere on your system (eg: `/opt/ArachneMergeTool` or `/usr/local/ArachneMergeTool` on Linux and Mac)

Update your `.gitconfig` file (either global or per repository) :


    [merge]
    tool = amt
    conflictstyle = diff3
    [mergetool "amt"]
    cmd = /path/to/ArachneMergeTool.py -b "$BASE" -l "$LOCAL" -r "$REMOTE" -m "$MERGED"

or just type the following in a shell prompt :


    $ git config --global merge.tool amt
    $ git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3
    $ git config --global mergetool.extMerge.cmd 'python /path/to/ArachneMergeTool.py -b "$BASE" -l "$LOCAL" -r "$REMOTE" -m "$MERGED"'

Please note that most automatic conflict solvers need the `merge.conflictstyle` property set to diff3 to work properly


## Configuration

You can have a global configuration (in ~/.amtconfig) or provide a custom config file in the command
line (with the `-c/--config` optional argument).

    [ArachneMergeTool]
    tools = mytool;meld;kdiff;vimdiff

    [mergetool "mytool"]
    cmd = /path/to/mytool --diff $LOCAL $BASE --diff $BASE $REMOTE --diff $LOCAL $MERGED $REMOTE


The most important configuration is the `tools` option which lists the different merge tools in order. If the first listed tool fails, the second one is launched, etc...

For each tool listed in the `tools` option, you can have a `[mergetool "name"]` sectionÂ¸ which is compatible with `.gitconfig` syntax, with the following options :

 - **path** : the path to the tool, if it's not already available in PATH
 - **cmd** : a custom command line invocation. You can use the following variable in the command line : `$BASE`, `$LOCAL`, `$REMOTE` and `$MERGED`
 - **trustExitCode** : if set to true, this will assume that the exit code reflects the success of the merge. Otherwise, ArachneMergeTool will prompt the user to indicate the success of the resolution after the merge tool has exited.

## Known merge tools

## Internal automatic merge tools

ArachneMergeTool comes bundled with a few automated tools that you can use to handle some known and tedious conflicts easily.

#### MergeJavaImports

This tool will handle any conflict within the imports section of your java files.

You can add the following options :
 - **mergetool.mji.order** : specify the way to order imports. Presets include Android Studio : `android`; IntelliJ Idea : `idea`; and Eclipse : `eclipse`

#### MergeAdditionConflicts

This tool will handle any conflict for which the local and remote versions add content in the same place

You can add the following options :
 - **mergetool.mac.order** : sets the preference when adding both sides; can be `remotefirst` (default), `localfirst`, or `ask`
 - **mergetool.mac.report** : sets the type of report to write next to the merged file (if the merged file is `foo.ext`, the report will be `foo.ext.mac`)
    - `solved` : logs all the conflicts solved by the tool (and how it was solved
    - `unsolved` : logs all the unsolved conflicts
    - `full` : logs both the solved and unsolved conflicts
    - `none` : doesn't write a report file

#### MergeWovenConflicts

This tool will handle any conflict for which the local and remote modify different lines. 

You can add the following options :
 - **mergetool.mwc.report** : sets the type of report to write next to the merged file (if the merged file is `foo.ext`, the report will be `foo.ext.mwc`)
    - `solved` : logs all the conflicts solved by the tool (and how it was solved
    - `unsolved` : logs all the unsolved conflicts
    - `full` : logs both the solved and unsolved conflicts
    - `none` : doesn't write a report file

## Caveats

ArachneMergeTool requires Python 3.x, and won't work with Python 2.x

## Todo

 - For now only meld is recognized as a known merging tool. Others could be included from [Git's mergetools code](https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/mergetools).
 - Allow different configurations based on file type (eg : `tools.java = foo`)
